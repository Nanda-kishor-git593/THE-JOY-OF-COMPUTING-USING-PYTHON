## movie_guessing_game.py

**Description:**  
A two-player movie guessing game inspired by Hangman.  
- The program picks a random movie name from a predefined list.
- Each player, on their turn, guesses letters to try to reveal the hidden movie title.
- Players can choose to guess the full movie name after revealing letters.
- Scores are tracked, and players can play multiple rounds, quitting when they wish.

**Code Structure:**
- The movie list is defined at the start of the script.
- The function `create_question(movie)` hides all letters in the movie name with asterisks (`*`), leaving spaces visible.
- The function `is_present(letter, movie)` checks whether the guessed letter exists in the movie name.
- The function `unlock(qn, movie, letter)` reveals all occurrences of the guessed letter in the hidden movie name.
- The function `play()` runs the game and:
    1. Takes player names
    2. Alternates turns, selects a movie each turn, and manages input/logic for revealing letters, guessing, and scoring
    3. Lets players continue for as many rounds as they like, tracking and displaying scores

**Usage:**
- Run the script with Python 3.x.
- Enter player names when prompted.
- Follow the prompts to guess letters or solve the movie name.
- The game continues until you choose to quit, at which point the scores are displayed.
