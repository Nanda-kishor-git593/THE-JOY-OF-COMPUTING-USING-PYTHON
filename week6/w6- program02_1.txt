Krishna	smiled and started throwing down the clothes, said Gopinath.The gopikas wore their saris and after they were well-clothed, Krishna descended from the top and the dancing began.
 
The sounds of music and	dance filled the air and the night ended on a joyful note.
The Harikatha dasa told	us to open our eyes. Thatâ€™s when we found out that two and a half hours	had passed.
